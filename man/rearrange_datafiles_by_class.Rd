\description{
Although Data Preprocessing can be performed using any
filepath with the \code{XCMS} Package, it is convenient to
rearrange data files by sample class (that is, all the
samples belonging to the same sample class are included
in the same folder). We do this because, after the
Preprocessing stage, the \code{MAIT} Package takes care
of Data Annotation and Metabolite Identification. \code{MAIT}
needs a specific directory structure for data managing.
Otherwise, it can't work properly.
